After running the commands in your terminal to open the targeted repository, 'cd your-repo-name', run the install command, 'npm install', to install packages and modules. Then run the command, 'node index.js', to start the README Generator!

## Contributing
If any changes are made that you'd like to commit, please follow these instructions. Run these terminal commands, 'git status' to show the untracked changes that have been made, 'git add -A' to now track those changes, 'git commit -m "short message explaining changes made" to commit changes made and a short message explaining them, 'git push origin main' to push your changes to the main branch of the repo, OR 'git push origin your-branch-name' to push changes to a branch of the repo you made, then make a git pull request on github for the merge and changes to be approved. Another option is to fork the repo yourself and push your changes to your own fork of the repo.
